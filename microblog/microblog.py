from app import app

# The Flask application instance is called app, and is a member of
# the app package (the folder name).

# With this script, we now have a minimal working example
# of a Flask application.

# Before running, Flask needs to be told how to import our resources,
# which is done by setting the FLASK_APP environment variable.
# Windows: use `set FLASK_APP=microblog.py` in CMD. Also see the file .flaskenv,
# to see how to define environmental variables for the Flask application.

# Run the application using the following command: flask run

# Note that going to localhost:5000/ or localhost:5000/index will
# output the same result.
