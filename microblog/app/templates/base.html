        <!--Here, we use the construct with, to assign the result of calling
          get_flashed_messages() to a messages variable, all in the context
          of the template.
          
          The function get_flashed_messages() comes from Flask, and returns
          a list of all the messages that have been registered with flash()
          previously. The conditional that follows checks if messages has some
          content. If messages does have some content, a <ul> element is
          rendered with each message as an <li> list item.

          We note that this style of rendering is not visually appealing,
          but we will get to that later.

          An interesting property of these flashed messages is that, once they
          are requested once through the get_flashed_messages function, they
          are removed from the message list, so they appear only once after the
          flash() function is called.
