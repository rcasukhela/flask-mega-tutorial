{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>User: {{ user.username }}</h1>
    {% for post in posts %}
    <div><p>{{ post.author.username }} says: <b>{{ post.body }}</b></p></div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}

<!--Since the base.html template will now take care of the general page
structure, I have removed all those elements from index.html and left only
the content
part. The extends statement establishes the inheritance link between the two
templates, so that Jinja2 knows that when it is asked to render index.html
it needs to embed it inside base.html. The two templates have matching block
statements with name content, and this is how Jinja2 knows how to combine
the two templates into one. Now if I need to create additional pages for the
application, I can create them as derived templates from the same base.html
template, and that is how I can have all the pages of the application sharing
the same look and feel without duplication.-->
